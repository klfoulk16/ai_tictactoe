# ai_tictactoe
Quick game I designed to allow you to play tic tac toe against your computer. The project goal was to use a minimax function and alpha-beta pruning to teach the computer how to play both optimally and quickly. So far I have not beat it. 

The playing board is a little rough as it is located in the command line, but I attempted to make it as easy to follow as possible.
